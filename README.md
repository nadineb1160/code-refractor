I took existing code and refactored to meet specific criteria and to make it more accesible. As a developer, I want to meet accessibility standards so that our site is optimized for search engines.

        <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>

        <p>
            The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are 
            searching for the right business as they travel, shop, 
            or sit on their couch at home. 
            Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase 
            your visibility and find the right customers for your 
            business.
